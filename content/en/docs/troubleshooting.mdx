# Troubleshooting

## Dialog does not appear

Ensure `<Notifin />` is mounted at app root.

```tsx
<>
  <Notifin />
  {children}
</>
```

## API called before host is ready

Only call `notifin.*` after React has mounted and host exists.

## ESC does not close dialog

Set `allowEscapeClose: true` and keep `dismissible: true`.

```tsx
notifin.info("Press esc to close", {
  dismissible: true,
  allowEscapeClose: true,
});
```

## Too many queued dialogs

- Add `duration` for non-critical messages.
- Use `notifin.update` instead of creating new dialogs.
- Use `notifin.dismiss(id)` when flow is complete.
